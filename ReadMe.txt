*********************LLVM COOKBOOK****************************************************************************

-The files in this bundle are the essential files mentioned in the
chapters, please make sure you are reffering these files for
complete refference as the code shown in the book are specific
snippets of the actual code.


-There are essential packages separated in each chapter that you can
 make install to run the code. packages are c-make files that you can
directly incorporate in your working llvm folder.

-Not all steps are covered to run the files point to point as the book 
is focussed at a higher learning level and you might have to research 
on the internet to get some commands working. Most components are
opensource and can change without intimation from the developers,
So you need to research for alternative ways to work on a command if the
ones explained in the book dont work per se.

-LLVM setup is not entirely covered in this book, so its assumed you have
a working LLVM setup and Clang installed.

-Although you can refer: https://solarianprogrammer.com/2013/01/17/building-clang-libcpp-ubuntu-linux/, to 
install and build LLVM and Clang..

- Make sure you have the following installed before you setup LLVM:
  sudo apt-get update 
  sudo apt-get install build-essential
  sudo apt-get install g++

- Observe that there are Readme files some of the chapter folders, Please make sure
you read them before you begin using the files.
